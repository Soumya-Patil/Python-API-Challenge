# Note to the TAs

The WeatherPy Folder has two Jupyter  Notebooks one Original and the other a Copy. You can click either one of them for a completed assignment. The Copy file just has the Line Equation in the regression Plots showing clearly inside the figure, instead of being explicitly printed in the Original notebook.
